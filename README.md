# Cell Simulator

Authors: Max Morhardt, Michael Lesmez, Adam Behrman, and Kara Palumbo

This project runs three types of cell simulations: Wild Fire, Game of Life, and Rock Paper Scissors. Using JavaFX, we created a GUI where these simulations can be watched and the user has the ability to change parameters to alter the simulation. To run this program, start through Main and set values before hitting start.

Wild Fire represents a forest where trees are on fire within it. The user can alter many features of the forest and the intensity of the forest fire.

Rock Paper Scissors compares the cells around it and a threshold to see whether or not a certain cell has beaten or been defeated by the rock, paper, or scissor cells around it. If it has been beaten, it becomes that cell's state.

Game of Life tracks the life cycle of bacteria. If there are too many cells to infect or too little, a bacteria cell will die. But, if a bacteria cell is surrounded by two or three non infected cells, it will infect those.
